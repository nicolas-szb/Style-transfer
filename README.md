# Project Style Transfer

This project is based on image processing with TensorFlow.
The goal was to use a tensorflow tutorial in order to transfer a style image on a content image.

## Description

For this project I found an picture painted by the dutch artist Rembrandt and I decided to apply the Rembrandt style on an other picture.

I made several trials with several artists (Monet, Picasso, Seurat) but ma favourite is the Rembrandt's.
